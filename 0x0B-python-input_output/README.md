Project Title
0x0B. Python - Input/Output

Description
This repository contains solutions for a series of tasks related to Input/Output in Python. These tasks include working with file input/output, JSON serialization/deserialization, and handling various file manipulation operations. The tasks cover topics such as reading from files, writing to files, working with JSON data, and implementing class methods for serialization and deserialization.

Learning Objectives
Understanding file handling in Python
Using different file operations: read, write, append
Serialization and deserialization of JSON data
Creating and manipulating Python objects and converting them to JSON representations
Working with classes and instance attributes
Project Structure
0-read_file.py
Read a text file (UTF8) and print its content to stdout.
1-write_file.py
Write a string to a text file (UTF8) and return the number of characters written.
2-append_write.py
Append a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and return the number of characters added.
3-to_json_string.py
Return the JSON representation of an object (string).
4-from_json_string.py
Return a Python data structure represented by a JSON string.
5-save_to_json_file.py
Write an object to a text file using a JSON representation.
6-load_from_json_file.py
Create an object from a JSON file.
7-add_item.py
Add arguments to a Python list and save them to a file using JSON representation.
8-class_to_json.py
Return a dictionary description for JSON serialization of an object.
9-student.py
Define a Student class and retrieve a dictionary representation of a Student instance.
10-student.py
Define a Student class with attribute filtering for JSON serialization.
11-student.py
Define a Student class and implement serialization and deserialization from a JSON representation.
12-pascal_triangle.py
Generate Pascal's triangle as a list of lists of integers.
100-append_after.py
Insert a line of text to a file after each line containing a specific string.
101-stats.py
Read stdin line by line and compute metrics for log parsing.
Resources
The project includes various resources:

Reading and Writing Files
Predefined Clean-up Actions
Dive Into Python 3: Chapter 11 (Files)
JSON encoder and decoder
Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (Chapter 8 and 14)
All about py-file I/O
Testing
The project includes test scripts and sample input/output files to verify the functionality and correctness of the implemented solutions. The tests cover different scenarios and edge cases for each task.

Usage
Each task is accompanied by a test script that demonstrates the functionality of the solution implemented for that task. To run the tests, execute the respective test script for each task.

Example:

css
Copy code
./0-main.py
./1-main.py
./2-main.py
