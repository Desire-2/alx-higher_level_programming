## 0x10. Python - Network #0

### Description

This project covers various aspects of network programming using Python and Bash scripting. It involves sending HTTP requests, handling responses, understanding HTTP methods, headers, cookies, and more. The project includes a series of tasks designed to reinforce understanding and proficiency in network protocols and communication.

### General Information

- **Author:** Guillaume
- **Weight:** 1
- **Project Duration:** Jan 25, 2024, 6:00 AM - Jan 26, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release Date:** Jan 25, 2024, 12:00 PM

### Resources

- HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) (except: “TRACE” Request Method, “CONNECT” Request Method, Language Negotiation and “Options MultiView” and Character Set Negotiation)
- HTTP Cookies

### Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, learners should be able to explain the following concepts without external assistance:

- Understanding of URLs, HTTP, and HTTP requests/responses
- Reading URLs and understanding their components
- Differentiating between HTTP methods, status codes, headers, and cookies
- Making requests using cURL and interpreting responses
- Understanding the process when typing a URL in a browser

### Requirements

- All scripts should be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Bash scripts should be exactly 3 lines long and end with a new line.
- All files must be executable and use `#!/bin/bash` as the first line for Bash scripts.
- Python scripts should use `#!/usr/bin/python3` as the first line and adhere to PEP8 style guidelines.
- All modules, classes, and functions should be properly documented.
- No plagiarism or content publishing is allowed.
