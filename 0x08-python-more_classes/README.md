0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects
This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program and focuses on learning more about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. This README.md will guide you through the various tasks within the project.

Project Overview
Project Duration: Oct 30, 2023, 6:00 AM - Oct 31, 2023, 6:00 AM
Checker Release: Oct 30, 2023, 12:00 PM
Auto Review: A review will be automatically launched at the deadline.
Resources
The project resources consist of reading materials and videos that will provide insights into various concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in Python.

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to understand and explain the following concepts:

Basics of Python programming and why it's advantageous
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and its fundamentals
The concept of "first-class everything" in Python
Understanding classes, objects, and instances
Differences between class and object/instance
Attributes: public, protected, and private; their usage
Understanding 'self', methods, and the special __init__ method
Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
Properties and their distinction from attributes
Pythonic ways of writing getters and setters
Special __str__ and __repr__ methods and their differences
Class attributes vs. object attributes
Class methods and static methods
Dynamic creation of attributes for existing class instances
How Python finds the attributes of an object or class
Usage of getattr function in Python
Requirements
Editors: Allowed editors include vi, vim, emacs.
Interpreter: All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5).
Coding Standards: Your code should follow PEP8 standards (using pycodestyle).
File Requirements: All files must end with a new line, start with #!/usr/bin/python3, and be executable.
Tasks Overview
The project consists of several tasks that aim to progressively build your understanding of classes and objects in Python:

Simple Rectangle: Define a basic Rectangle class.
Real Definition of a Rectangle: Introduce private attributes for width and height with property setters and getters.
Area and Perimeter: Extend the Rectangle class to calculate area and perimeter.
String Representation: Enhance the Rectangle class to provide string representation.
Eval is Magic: Implement the capability to recreate a Rectangle instance using eval().
Detect Instance Deletion: Implement a message upon instance deletion.
Change Representation: Allow changing the symbol for string representation.
Compare Rectangles: Compare rectangles based on area.
A Square is a Rectangle: Extend the Rectangle class to create a square instance.
N Queens (Advanced): Solve the N queens puzzle, placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard.
How to Run the Code
Each task has its own file, and you can run these files in your preferred Python environment. Execute the files and observe the outputs to understand and verify the functionality of the implemented classes and methods.

Task Specifics
Each task has its specific requirements, detailing how the classes and methods should be implemented. Ensure compliance with these requirements to successfully complete the tasks.
