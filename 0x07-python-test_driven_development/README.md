Project Details
This project began on Oct 26, 2023, at 6:00 AM and must be completed by Nov 1, 2023, at 6:00 AM. The checker will be released at Nov 1, 2023, at 6:00 AM.

Concepts Covered
For this project, the focus is on the concept "Never forget a test."

Background Context
An important notice has been made regarding intranet checks for Python projects, emphasizing:

Writing documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests before coding.
The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline to emphasize more focus on TDD.
Encouragement to work together on test cases to cover all possible edge cases.
Resources and Learning Objectives
Resources
doctest — Test interactive Python examples (until “26.2.3.7. Warnings” included)
doctest – Testing through documentation
Unit Tests in Python
Unittest module
Interactive and Non-interactive tests
Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you'll be able to explain without using Google:

Why Python programming is awesome
What an interactive test is
The importance of tests
Writing Docstrings for creating tests
Documentation writing for each module and function
Basic option flags to create tests
Finding edge cases
Copyright - Plagiarism
You're expected to come up with solutions to meet the learning objectives.
Plagiarism in any form is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
Requirements
Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
Compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.5)
All files should end with a new line
The first line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All files must be executable
File length will be tested using wc
Python Test Cases
Test files should be inside a folder named "tests"
Test files should be text files with the extension .txt
Tests executed by using: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
Modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
Functions should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
Tasks
Integers addition
Divide a matrix
Say my name
Print square
Text indentation
Max integer - Unittest
Matrix multiplication
Lazy matrix multiplication
CPython #3: Python Strings
Tasks are detailed in the original documentation.

Directory Structure
The project directory 0x07-python-test_driven_development should contain various Python scripts for the tasks listed in the project. Inside, you will find a tests directory housing the corresponding test cases as text files.

Task-specific files:
0-add_integer.py
tests/0-add_integer.txt
2-matrix_divided.py
tests/2-matrix_divided.txt
3-say_my_name.py
tests/3-say_my_name.txt
4-print_square.py
tests/4-print_square.txt
5-text_indentation.py
tests/5-text_indentation.txt
6-max_integer.py
tests/6-max_integer_test.py
100-matrix_mul.py
tests/100-matrix_mul.txt
101-lazy_matrix_mul.py
tests/101-lazy_matrix_mul.txt
102-python.c
Completion and Submissions
The project is expected to be completed within the stipulated timeframe. The submission of the project will undergo an automated review. The Python scripts will be evaluated for adherence to the specified requirements, documentation quality, and passable test cases.
