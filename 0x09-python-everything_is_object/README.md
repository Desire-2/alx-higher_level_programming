* 0x09. Python - Everything is an Object
Project Description
This project delves into the concept that everything in Python is an object and aims to explore how Python operates with various types of objects, distinguishing between mutable and immutable objects. The project presents various scenarios and questions about Python's specificities and challenges the participants to understand and reason about the behavior of different object types without resorting to immediate code implementation.

Background Context
The project begins by encouraging participants to explore how Python handles various types of objects, emphasizing the difference between mutable and immutable types. It also prompts participants to grasp the consequences of variable assignment and referencing in Python.

Learning Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to equip participants with a comprehensive understanding of Python's handling of objects, aiming to address questions such as:

Differentiating between classes and objects/instances
Recognizing the differences between mutable and immutable objects
Understanding references, assignments, and aliases in Python
Identifying identical and linked variables and objects
Displaying variable identifiers and recognizing memory addresses
Understanding the concept of mutability and immutability in Python
Recognizing built-in mutable and immutable types
Understanding how Python passes variables to functions
Requirements
Python Scripts:

Editors: vi, vim, emacs
Execution: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
Code style: pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
Execution permissions: All files must be executable
.txt Answer Files:

Single line answers with no Shebang at the beginning
Each file should end with a newline character
Tasks
This project is structured into multiple tasks, each aiming to reinforce the understanding of Python's object behavior through questions and code scenarios.

Tasks include:

Who am I?: Identifying the function to get the type of an object.
Where are you?: Finding the function to get the variable identifier.
2-32. A series of questions and scenarios exploring object referencing, mutability, immutability, variable assignments, and more.
33-34. Advanced questions addressing memory allocation and object creation.
Resources and Learning Materials
Participants are encouraged to explore various resources, including Python documentation, articles, and learning materials that specifically cover object types, immutability, mutability, and memory management in Python.

Copyright and Plagiarism
Participants are expected to independently address the tasks, avoiding any form of plagiarism. The focus is on understanding and internalizing the concepts rather than copying solutions from external sources.

Conclusion
This project is designed to enhance the understanding of how Python treats objects and variables, reinforcing the principles of mutability, immutability, references, and assignments in the Python programming language.
