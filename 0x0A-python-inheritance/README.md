# 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

## Overview
This project is a collection of Python scripts that focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the concept of inheritance in Python. The project spans a series of tasks that aim to reinforce understanding of inheritance, superclass, subclass, methods and attributes, and related concepts in Python.

## Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to deepen your understanding of inheritance in Python. You'll learn about superclass, subclass, methods, and attributes inherited from base classes, overriding inherited methods, and the general purpose and utility of inheritance in programming.

### Resources
- Inheritance
- Multiple inheritance
- Inheritance in Python
- Learn to Program 10 : Inheritance Magic Methods

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you're expected to grasp the following without needing external references:
- Why Python programming is awesome
- Superclass, baseclass, or parentclass
- Subclass and its attributes/methods
- Listing all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- Adding new attributes to an instance
- Inheriting a class from another
- Defining a class with multiple base classes
- Default class that every class inherits from
- Method or attribute override in inherited classes
- Attributes/methods available by heritage to subclasses
- Purpose and utility of inheritance
- Use of isinstance, issubclass, type, and super built-in functions

## Project Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files end with a new line
- First line in all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Code should follow PEP 8 style (using pycodestyle)
- All files must be executable

### Python Test Cases
- All test files should be inside a folder named 'tests'
- Test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- Tests should be executed using: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- Modules, classes, and functions should have documentation explaining their purpose

### Documentation
- Avoid using 'import' or 'from' within comments
- Document the purpose of modules, classes, and methods in real sentences

### Copyright and Plagiarism
- Strictly forbidden to plagiarize or publish project content
- Plagiarism will result in removal from the program

## Tasks
The project is divided into several tasks, each focusing on specific concepts and implementation of Python inheritance. For each task, the objective, expected output, and guidelines for implementation are provided.

The tasks include:
0. Lookup
1. My list
2. Exact same object
3. Same class or inherit from
4. Only subclass of
5. Geometry module
6. Improve Geometry
7. Integer validator
8. Rectangle
9. Full rectangle
10. Square #1
11. Square #2

For detailed instructions, refer to the respective task files in the repository.

## Repository Information
The project repository is stored on GitHub under the directory 'alx-higher_level_programming'. Each task has its dedicated file and test folders.

For the files related to a specific task, refer to the respective file in the directory.

Happy coding!
